# client-template

This is a very minimal and simplistic Vue 3 application. It includes a ready-to-use services folder to interact with an API. The application also has route guards in place to control user flow. The UI and design is very flexible, most of which is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) and a few components from [Prime Vue](https://primevue.org/setup). It also include a Dockerfile for deployment.

This was done in colaboration with [voglster](https://github.com/voglster).
